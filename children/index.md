## What kind of information will I provide?

You will be required to provide information that describes the child – the main character – and the recent adventure you want the book to be about. This information may include, without limitation, the child’s name, age, gender, characteristic traits, a brief description of the event you want the story to be about, and your email address. 

This information will help the software to uniquely piece the elements together and generate a book that is personalized to the child and the area of adventure or action you provide.

## How secure is my child’s information?

We take privacy and data security very seriously. We use commercially reasonable mechanisms to protect the information you provide from unauthorized access, theft, and use. We only collect this information to create a customized storybook for the said child, and we destroy the data once we no longer need it. You can review our Privacy Policy for more information about our data protection practices.

## What age range is suitable for?

Our personalized books are suitable for children between the ages of 1 and 8 years old. We believe that reading is a fundamental aspect of a child's development, and our books are designed to promote a love for reading and spark imagination.

We carefully craft each story to engage and entertain children within this age range while providing a personalized touch that makes the story more relatable and enjoyable.

## Can I add my own images to the book?

We currently don't offer the option to add personal images to the book. However, we use high-quality illustrations that match the story and personalize the main character based on the information you provide.

Our illustration tool works hard to create engaging and colorful visuals that bring the story to life. We want the illustrations to match the story and the child's character traits, so we make sure to get all the necessary information from you during the customization process.

## What languages are available for the personalized books?

Currently, our personalized books are available in English and Spanish. We understand the importance of promoting multilingualism and are continuously working to expand our offering to other languages.

We want children from all over the world to enjoy our personalized books and experience the joy of reading. Our team is constantly exploring ways to expand our language options to make our books accessible to more families around the globe. Stay tuned for updates on new language options!

## How long will it take to receive the book?

Once you provide the required information, the software requires a few minutes to create the most personalized story. This should just take a few minutes, and a preview should arrive at your email address in no time. You can then proceed to make the payment to receive your copy.

## What format and how many pages will the book have?

The book will be a digital version that comes in PDF format.

Each book has approximately 20-25 pages, depending on the length of the story and the amount of personalization required.

## I made a mistake. Can I edit the book?

We understand that mistakes can happen, which is why we have a preview stage where you can make any necessary changes before making the final purchase. During the preview stage, you can review the entire book, including the story and illustrations.

If you find any errors or want to make changes to the information you provided, you can make the necessary adjustments before finalizing your order. Once you have made the necessary changes, you can proceed to purchase the book, and the final version will reflect your updated information.

## How much does it cost?

Each book created costs $19, which includes the personalized storybook and the digital PDF version. We believe in providing an affordable and unique experience for children, and our price reflects our commitment to this goal.

Additionally, we often offer discounts and promotions that can lower the price even further. Be sure to check our website or subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated on any ongoing promotions.

## Can I preview the book before purchase?

Yes, we understand that you want to ensure that the book is perfect for your child before making a purchase. That's why we provide a preview of the entire book on the story preview page. The preview includes the personalized story and illustrations, giving you a chance to review the book and make sure that it meets your expectations.

If you're satisfied with the book, you can proceed to purchase the final version, which will be delivered to your email address in digital PDF format.

## How long will I have access to the digital version of the book?
