## What kind of information will I provide?

You will be required to provide information that describes the child – the main character – and the recent adventure you want the book to be about. This information may include, without limitation, the child’s name, age, gender, characteristic traits, a brief description of the event you want the story to be about, and your email address. 

This information will help the software to uniquely piece the elements together and generate a book that is personalized to the child and the area of adventure or action you provide. 

## How long will it take to receive the book?

Once you provide the required information, the software requires a few minutes to create the most personalized story. This should just take a few minutes, and a preview should arrive at your email address in no time. You can then proceed to make the payment to receive your copy.  

## What format will the book be in?

The book will be a digital version that comes in PDF format. 

## How much does it cost?

Each book created costs $19. However, it may be lower due to discounts and promotions. 

## How secure is my child’s information?

We take privacy and data security very seriously. We use commercially reasonable mechanisms to protect the information you provide from unauthorized access, theft, and use. We only collect this information to create a customized storybook for the said child, and we destroy the data once we no longer need it. You can review our Privacy Policy for more information about our data protection practices. 

## Can I preview the book before purchase?

Absolutely! After the software generates a suitable story, a preview will be provided on the story preview page. 

## I made a mistake. Can I edit the book?

Yes, you can make the necessary changes during the preview stage.
